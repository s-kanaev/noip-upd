This is no-ip.com service update client package version 0.1 (first)
Package consists of:
README                         this file
noip-upd.c                     no-ip update client source code
noip-upd.bin                   client binary
noip-upd.conf                  client config file
noip-upd-conf.sh               client configurator
noip-upd.sh                    client sequental runer (runs client binary sequentaly)
noip-upd.inc                   variables for 'noip-upd.sh'

This client uses 'no-ip.com' API to update ip address.

To configure client run:
    noip-upd-conf.sh <config-file-name>
<config-file-name> is file name of config file for noip-upd.bin file.

BTW one can edit client config file manualy.
 But config file strings are to be in strict order.
 The order is -
 line number - what should typed in to this line
 0           - Base64-encoded login:password string
 1           - hostname to update
 2           - update server (typicaly dynupdate.no-ip.com)
 No keywords are to be in noip-upd.conf file

noip-upd.inc file has variables for noip-upd.sh file.
    Variables needed for noip-upd.sh script:
    Variable name - its meaning
    ALLOW_UPD_F   - file with allowing or disallowing of ip update process
    ALLOW_WORD    - word which allows ip update process when is typed
                    in to ALLOW_UPD_F file
    DISALLOW_WORD - word which disallows ip update process when is typed
                    in to ALLOW_UPD_F file
    TIMEh         - hours update period part
    TIMEm         - minutes update period part
                    update period = TIMEh*60+TIMEm (minutes)
    NOIP_UPD      - path (with file name) to noip-upd.bin
    NOIP_UPD_CONF - path (with filename) to noip-upd.conf
    NO_EXEC       - String which is to be written to ALLOW_UPD_F file
                if no NOIP_UPD is found and if it is not executable

To launch update process 'noip-upd.sh' should be started but with it's
full path, i.e:
    /usr/local/bin/noip-upd.sh

Maybe it this file is not full to be full documentation for noip-upd client.
If so do not hesitate to email me to ksergy.91 <at> gmail.com

You can dynamicaly edit its configuration file (i.e. once you run noip-upd.sh you are still able to edit configuration files - noip-upd.conf and noip-upd.inc).

To compile run
    gcc ./noip-upd.c -o ./noip-upd.bin

To 'install' - just copy noip-upd.bin, noip-upd.conf, noip-upd.inc, noip-upd.sh to whereever you want and set configuration variables.
